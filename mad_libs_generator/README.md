# Thinking process
What if i create a mad lib generator but make it automative idk if thats the righht word but I could like scarpe words from several word bank websites and store
like all the adjectives , nouns, verbs, ask the user for some text and use those words to fill in the blanks it could go as far as checking to see if those words make sense to the sentences around it maybe using like vector refrences concept 

Challenges: 

see what counts as mad libs 
find the word banks, excrat them and store them properly 
ask user for some text and give me like blank of what type of word should be in that blank Ex: pushing the computer NOUN. Computers bla bla. 


Nice have: 

just have the user enter blank and have the generator figure out what words should be there like nouns, adjectives, verbs etc
